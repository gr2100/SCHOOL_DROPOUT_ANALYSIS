# Student Dropout Analysis and Prediction for School Education

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for the "Student Dropout Analysis and Prediction for School Education" project, developed by Team Deadline Tech for the Smart India Hackathon 2023. 

### Problem Statement

**Problem Statement Title:** Student dropout analysis and prediction for school education

### Idea/Approach Details

#### Idea

Our approach to addressing the problem of student dropout in school education involves the following steps:

1. **Data Gathering**: We will compile dropout statistics by school, neighborhood, gender, caste, and age/standard.

2. **Data Integration**: Data integration is the process of combining data into a single database.

3. **Data Analysis**: We will analyze data using Python with libraries and data extraction tools, creating visualizations for statistics.

4. **Pattern Identification**: We aim to find patterns in dropout rates to identify trends.

5. **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigate the causes of dropouts in each category using root cause analysis techniques.

6. **Policy Development**: Create focused policies based on causes and trends identified through analysis.

7. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Constantly evaluate the effects of policies to make necessary adjustments.

8. **Transparency and Accountability**: Make findings and development updates available to the public.

#### Technology Stack

- **Data Collection**: Data will be collected from the official government website.

- **Data Integration and Analysis**: Python will be used with libraries and data extraction tools.

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Building machine learning models.

- **Documentation**: Google Docs, Microsoft Word, Overleaf.

### Use Cases

Our project has several potential use cases:

- **Governmental Offices of Education**: Analysis of dropout data and knowledge of the particular difficulties experienced by various student groups can be used by education authorities to create data-driven policy recommendations.

- **NGOs and Nonprofits**: Organizations focused on enhancing education can develop and execute action programs that target certain dropout triggers like poverty or gender inequities.

- **Academics and Researchers**: Researchers can utilize this information to carry out academic research on factors that influence dropout rates and the efficiency of various policies.

### Dependencies and Show Stoppers

#### Dependencies

- **Data Accessibility**: Valid dropout statistics are essential for research and policy development.

- **Data Integration Tools**: It is vital to have access to tools for combining and centralizing data.

- **Data Analysis and Visualization Tools**: Must be accessible to gain insights.

#### Show Stoppers

- **Data Security and Privacy**: Issues can prevent data sharing and gathering from occurring.

- **Challenges in Monitoring and Evaluating Policy Impact**: This includes resource requirements and practical difficulties.
